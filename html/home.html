<i><b><p class="titleChapter">DOWN THE RABBIT-HOLE </p></b></i>
<p class="text"><b>ALICE</b> was beginning to get very tired of
    sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having
    nothing to do: once or twice she<br> had peeped into
    the book her sister was reading, but it had no
    pictures or conversations in it, “ and what is the use of a book,</br>” thought Alice, “ without
    pictures or conversations ?”</p>
<p class="text2">So she was considering in her own mind,
    (as well as she could, for the hot day made
    her feel very sleepy and stupid,) whether<br> the
    pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be
    worth the trouble of getting up and picking
    the daisies, when suddenly a white </br>rabbit with
    pink eyes ran close by her.
</p>
<p class="text3">There was nothing so very remarkable in
    that; nor did Alice think it so very much out
    of the way to hear the Rabbit say to <br>itself,
    “ Oh dear ! Oh dear ! I shall be too late !”
    (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought
    to</br> have wondered
    at this, but at the time it all seemed quite
    natural); but when the Rabbit actually took a
    watch out of its <br>waistcoat-pocket, and looked at
    it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her
    feet, for it flashed across her mind that she </br>had
    never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket
    or a watch to take out of it, and,
    burning with curiosity, she <br>ran across the field
    after it, and was just in time to see it pop
    down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.</br> <br>
    In another moment down went Alice after
    it, never once considering how in the world
    she was to get out again.The rabbit-hole</br> went straight on like a
    tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly
    down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment<br>
    to think about stopping herself before she found
    herself falling down what seemed to be a very
    deep well.</br>
    <br>Either the well was very deep, or she fell
    very slowly, for she had plenty of time as she
    went down to look about her,and to </br> wonder
    what was going to happen next. First, she tried
    to look down and make out what she was
    coming to, but it was<br> too dark to see anything :
    then she looked at the sides of the well, and
    noticed that they were filled with cupboards</br>
    and bookshelves: here and there she saw maps
    and pictures hung upon pegs.
    <br>She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it
    was labelled “ ORANGE MARMALADE,” but
    to her</br> great disappointment it was empty: she did
    not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody underneath, so managed to put</br> it into
    one of the cupboards as she fell past it.<br>“Well !” thought Alice to herself, “ after
    such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of
    tumbling down stairs ! How brave they ’ll all
    </br>think me at home! Why, I wouldn’t say anything about it, even if I fell off the top of
    the house !” (Which was very likely true.)
</p>
<p class="text4"><br>Down, down, down. Would the fall never
    come to an end ? “ I wonder how many miles
    I ’ve fallen by this time ?” she said aloud. </br>“I
    must be getting somewhere near the centre of
    the earth.Let me see : that would be four
    thousand miles down, I think—” (for, <br>you see,
    Alice had learnt several things of this sort in
    her lessons in the schoolroom, and though this
    was not a very good </br>opportunity for showing off
    her knowledge ... </p>
